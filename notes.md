# Ideas

## Core features

- use OCR to scan expiry date (cf foodless app)
- use barcode for product information
- in which order? or both ?
- reminders some time before expiry (default/setting general/by category/by instance)
- fallback: use buttons for some predefined periods of time, e.g. "a week from now", "a month", "2 days"
  - with follow-up option to adjust date
- dashboard?:
  - first: expires soon!
  - button to add item to inventory
- after deleting, add to shoptping list

## Nice to have/ potential for future:

- food categories/tagging/notes/labels
- label for specific planned meals (recipe + ingredients)
- storage place e.g. fridge/freezer/pantry
- assign tags/names/notes to food "this is mine do not eat"
- yield food that you don't want anymore to housemates
- potential for household management, e.g. for roommates
- search for recipes using ingredients
