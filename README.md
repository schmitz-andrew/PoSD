This repository contains the project for the course 'Principle of Software Development'
This project is an overview of the development of an app to reduce food waste. 
The project itself is mandatory for the course 'Principle of Software Development' and the idea of the app was decided in the lecture by the students. 
The app should help the user to reduce their food waste by keeping track of the expire date via scanning the barcode to retrieve the data or by making a photo of the expire data. 
The app should notify the user about near future expiring food.
